Configuration Steps:

Create a service in PagerDuty and obtain the integration key (Events API v2).
Add a PagerDuty receiver in alertmanager.yml:
receivers:
   - name: 'pagerduty'
      pagerduty_configs:
         - routing_key: <YOUR_PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_KEY>
Set up routing in Alertmanager to send critical alerts to the PagerDuty receiver.
Ensure Prometheus alerting rules are defined for the conditions you want to be paged for.
